XMOS USB Audio 2.0 Reference Design (XS1-L2) Changelog
=====================================================

Release version: %%VERSION%% (build %%BUILDNUMBER%%)

Firmware
========

(Note: USB Audio version numbers unified accross all products at this point)

5v30
    - ADDED:      Added support for protocol Stall for un-recognised requests to Endpoint 0.
                  BOS Descriptor test in latest version of USB CV test now passes.
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Removed redundant delays in DFU image download.  This aids Windows DFU reliability. 
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) DFU Run-time descriptors updated from DFU 1.0 to DFU 1.1 spec.  This allows USB CV test pass.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) MIDI string descriptors added to string table.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) bInterval value for feedback endpoint modified to be more compatible with Microsoft OSs 
                  (support for iso endpoints with bInterval > 8 microframes).  This aids compatibility with 3rd party 
                  drivers for USB 3.0 controllers.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Fixed build failure when NUM_USB_CHAN_IN/NUM_USB_CHAN_OUT defined as 0. Previous INPUT/OUTPUT 
                  defines now based on NUM_USB_CHAN_XXX defines. 
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Fixed build failure when MIXER defined as 0.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) MAX_MIX_OUTPUTS define now effects device descriptors.  Previously only effected mixer 
                  processing.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Removed redundant calls to assert() to free memory. 

5v20:
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Fixed reset reliability for self-powered devices.  This was due to an issue with 
                  XUD/Endpoint synchronisation during communication of RESET bus state over channels.
                  Bus powered devices should not be effected due to power up on every plug event.  
                  Note: Changes limited to XUD library only.

5v11:
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Removed size in re-interpret cast of DFU data buffer (unsigned to unsigned char). This
                  was due to a new optimisation in the 11.2 compiler which removes part of the DFU buffer (dfu.xc)
                  as it considers it un-used.  This causes the DFU download request to fail due to stack corruption.

5v10:
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Fixed issue when sharing bus with other devices especially high throughput bulk devices 
                  (e.g. hard disk drive). This is issue typically caused SOFs to missed by the device 
                  resulting in incorrect feedback calculation and ultimately audio glitching.  Note: Changes
                  limited to XUD library only.
    - RESOLVED:   (Major) Intermittent issues with device chirp could lead to a bad packet on bus and device not
                  being properly detected as high-speed.  This was due to opmode of transceiver sometimes 
                  not being set before chirp. Note: Changes limited to XUD library only.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Intermittent USB CV Test fails with some hub models. Caused by test issuing suspend
                  during resume signalling. Note: Changes limited to XUD library only.               
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) bMaxPower now set to 10mA (was 500mA) since this is a self-powered design (see 
                  SELF_POWERED define)
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Added code to deal with malformed audio packets from a misbehaving driver.
                  Previously this could result in the device audio buffering raising an exception.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) First packet of audio IN stream now correct to current samplerate.  
                  Previously first packet was of length relating to previous sample rate.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) MIDI OUT buffering code simplified.  Now a single buffer used instead of 
                  previous circular buffer.
    - RESOLVED:   (Minor) Audio OUT stream buffer pre-fill level increased.
