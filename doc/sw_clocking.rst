External Clock Recovery
-----------------------

An application can either provide fixed master clock sources via selectable
oscillators, clock generation IC, etc., to provide the audio master or use 
an external PLL/Clock Multiplier to generate a master clock based on reference
from the XS1.

Using an external PLL/Clock Multiplier allows the design to lock to an
external clock source from a digital steam (e.g. S/PDIF or ADAT input).

The clock recovery core (clockGen) is responsible for generating the 
reference frequency to the Fractional-N Clock Generator. 
This, in turn, generates the master clock used over the whole design.

When running in *Internal Clock* mode this core simply generates
this clock using a local timer, based on the XS1 reference clock.

When running in an external clock mode (i.e. S/PDIF Clock" or "ADAT Clock" 
mode) digital samples are received from the S/PDIF and/or ADAT receive core.  
The external frequency is calculated through counting samples in a given 
period. The reference clock to the Fractional-N Clock Multiplier is 
then generated based on this external stream.  
If this stream becomes invalid, the timer event will fire to ensure that 
valid master clock generation continues regardless of cable unplugs etc.

This core gets clock selection Get/Set commands from Endpoint 0 via the 
``c_clk_ctl`` channel.  This core also records the validity of external 
clocks, which is also queried through the same channel from Endpoint 0.


This core also can cause the decouple core to request an interrupt 
packet on change of clock validity.  This functionality is based on the Audio Class 2.0 status/interrupt endpoint feature.
