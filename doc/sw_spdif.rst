S/PDIF Transmit
---------------

XS1 devices can support S/PDIF transmit up to 192kHz. 
The S/PDIF transmitter uses a
lookup table to encode the audio data. It receives samples from the
Audio core two at a time, one for each channel. For each sample,
it performs a lookup on each byte, generating 16 bits of encoded
data which it outputs to the port.

S/PDIF sends data in frames, each containing 192 samples of the
left and right channels.

The core takes PCM audio samples via a channel and outputs them
in S/PDIF format to a port. Audio samples are encapsulated into
S/PDIF words (adding preamble, parity, channel status and validity
bits) and transmitted in biphase-mark encoding (BMC) with respect
to an *external* master clock. Note that a minor change to the
``SpdifTransmitPortConfig`` function would enable *internal* master
clock generation (e.g. when clock source is already locked to
desired audio clock).

   D-Type Jitter Reduction


The S/PDIF signal is output at a rate dictated by the external
master clock. The master clock must be 1x 2x or 4x the BMC bit rate
(that is 128x 256x or 512x audio sample rate, respectively). The minimum 
master clock frequency for 192kHz is therefore 24.576MHz.

This resamples the master clock to its clock domain (oscillator), which
introduces jitter of 2.5-5 ns on the S/PDIF signal. A
typical jitter-reduction scheme is an external D-type flip-flop
clocked from the master clock (as shown in the preceding diagram).

Usage
+++++

The interface is normal channel with streaming built-ins
(``outuint``, ``inuint``). Data format is 24-bit left-aligned in a
32-bit word: ``0x12345600``

The following protocol is used on the channel:

Output stream structure
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The stream is composed of words with the following structure shown in
:ref:`usb_audio_spdif_stream_structure`. The channel status bits are
0x0nc07A4, where c=1 for left channel, c=2 for right channel and n
indicates sampling frequency as shown in :ref:`usb_audio_spdif_sample_bits`.
