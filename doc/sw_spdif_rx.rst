S/PDIF Receive
---------------

XS1 devices can support S/PDIF receive up to 192kHz. 

The S/PDIF receiver module uses a clockblock and a buffered one-bit port. 
The clock-block is divided of a 100 MHz reference clock. The one bit port 
is buffered to 4-bits. 

The receiver outputs audio samples over a *streaming channel end* where 
data can be input using the built-in input operator. 

The S/PDIF receive function never returns. The 32-bit value from the channel 
input comprises:

.. list-table:: S/PDIF RX Word Structure
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 32
     
     * - Bits 
       - 
     * - 0:3
       - A tag (see below) 
     * - 4:28
       - PCM encoded sample value
     * - 29:31
       - User bits (parity, etc)

The tag has one of three values:

.. list-table:: S/PDIF RX Tags
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 32
     
     * - Tag
       - Meaning
     * - FRAME\_X
       - Sample on channel 0 (Left for stereo)
     * - FRAME\_Y
       - Sample on another channel (Right if for stereo)
     * - FRAME\_Z
       - Sample on channel 0 (Left), and the first sample of a frame; can be used if the user bits need to be reconstructed.

See S/PDIF specification for further details on format, user bits etc.

Integration
+++++++++++

The S/PDIF receive function communicates with the clockGen component
with passes audio data to the audio driver and handles locking to the 
S/PDIF clock source if required (see Clock Recovery).

Ideally the parity of each word/sample received should be checked. 
This is done using the built in ``crc32`` function (see ``xs1.h``):

.. literalinclude:: sc_usb_audio/module_usb_audio/clocking/clockgen.xc
  :start-after: //:badParity
  :end-before: //:

If bad parity is detected the word/sample is ignored, else the tag 
is inspected for channel and the sample stored.

The following code snippet illustrates how the output of the S/PDIF
receive component could be used::


  while(1) {
     c_spdif_rx :> data;

     if(badParity(data)
       continue;

     tag = data & 0xF; 
     sample = (data << 4) & 0xFFFFFF00;

     switch(tag)
     {
       case FRAME_X:
       case FRAME_X:
         // Store left
         break;

       case FRAME_Z:
         // Store right
         break;
     }
  }
