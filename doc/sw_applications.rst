USB Audio Applications
----------------------

In addition to the overall framework, reference design
applications are provided (described in :ref:`usb_audio_sec_l1_audio_sw`, 
:ref:`usb_audio_sec_l2_audio_sw` and :ref:`usb_audio_sec_su1_audio_sw`). These applications provide qualified
configurations of the framework which support and are validated on
accompanying hardware.
